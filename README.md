Ansible NGINX NMS-App-Protect Compiler Role
=========
This ansible role helps in installing a Configuration Management for App Protect Compiler which is a feature in NGINX Instance Manager Module. With Configuration Management for App Protect WAF, you can configure WAF security policies in a single location and push your configurations out to one, some, or all of your NGINX App Protect WAF instances. 

Requirements

1. NGINX Management Suite License 
2. NGINX OSS or NGINX Plus

NGINX Management Suite Certificate Files
------------
Installing NMS requires the NMS certificate files to access the repository. Log in to MyF5 or follow the link in the trial activation email to download the NMS repo .crt and .key files:

- nginx-mgmt-suite-trial.key
- nginx-mgmt-suite-trial.crt

- NOTE: Be sure to rename these files to nginx-repo.key and nginx-repo.crt, respectively.

NGINX Instance

NMS requires an NGINX instance, either NGINX OSS or NGINX Plus as a frontend only. 
Main difference between using NGINX OSS or NGINX Plus depends on which Authentication Option you plan to use.
